Instructions for AIDER

* When creating or working on an existing function, the following
  requirements must be included in the work.
  + Class definitions should be immediately preceded by a comment line of
    hashes to column 78.
  + The function should be immediately preceded by a comment of dashed lines
    to column 78, including the first function in a class.
  + The function should have an up-to-date docstring that includes a short
    discussion of what the function does, a minimal number of examples, its
    expected inputs and its outputs.

* Any changes made to the file must be broken out into as small a change
  commit as makes sense for the change. E.g., changes should be kept to
  a single function per commit, documentation changes should be a separate
  commit, etc.

* Where possible, lines should be wrapped to column 78.
  + Do not break up file paths or urls, even if they have a space in them.
